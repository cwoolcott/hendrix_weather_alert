If the kiosk browser comes up but the page is blank / won’t load, 99% of the time the systemd service is pointing at the wrong folder (still /home/pi/weather-siren), so Node never starts.

Since your folder is hendrix_weather_alert, do these checks/fixes.

1) Confirm the server is actually down

On the Pi:

systemctl status weather-siren --no-pager


If it says “failed” or “could not be found”, check logs:

journalctl -u weather-siren -n 200 --no-pager

2) Confirm the folder + server file exist
ls -la /home/pi/hendrix_weather_alert
ls -la /home/pi/hendrix_weather_alert/server.js


If server.js is in a different place (like src/server.js), that matters.

3) Fix the systemd service to use the right folder

Open the service file:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/weather-siren.service


Update these two lines to match your folder:

WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/hendrix_weather_alert
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/pi/hendrix_weather_alert/server.js


Save, then reload systemd + restart:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart weather-siren
sudo systemctl status weather-siren --no-pager

4) If it still won’t start, the log will tell us exactly why

Run:

journalctl -u weather-siren -n 200 --no-pager


Common errors you’ll see:

“Cannot find module …” → npm install not run in that folder

“node: not found” → wrong node path

Permission errors → wrong user or file ownership

5) Confirm Node is installed and where it is
which node
node -v


If which node is not /usr/bin/node, update ExecStart to the path it prints.

6) Make sure dependencies are installed in the correct folder
cd /home/pi/hendrix_weather_alert
npm install
sudo systemctl restart weather-siren

7) Quick “is it listening?” test
curl -I http://localhost:3000


You want an HTTP response (200/304/etc). If curl can’t connect, Node isn’t running.

If you paste the output of these two commands, I’ll tell you the exact fix line-by-line:

systemctl status weather-siren --no-pager
journalctl -u weather-siren -n 80 --no-pager
